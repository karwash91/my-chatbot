Architecture Overview
---------------------
Understanding the underlying architecture of DevOpsy is crucial to leveraging its full potential. DevOpsy is built around a modular, microservices-oriented design that enables flexible orchestration and management of distributed applications.

### Core Components
- **Controller**: The central orchestration engine that manages the lifecycle of services, scaling decisions, and deployment workflows. It communicates with worker nodes and stores the state in a distributed key-value store.
- **Agent**: Installed on each worker node, the agent executes commands from the controller, manages container lifecycles, and reports health and metrics back to the controller.
- **CLI Interface**: The command-line tool that operators use to interact with DevOpsy, issue commands, and retrieve status information.
- **Dashboard**: A web-based UI (optional) that provides visual insights into cluster health, deployments, and logs.
- **Storage Backend**: Typically a distributed key-value store (e.g., etcd or Consul) that maintains cluster state, configurations, and service metadata.

### Deployment Model
DevOpsy can be deployed on-premises or in cloud environments. It supports hybrid clusters, enabling you to manage resources across multiple data centers or cloud providers seamlessly. The system is designed to be highly available, with failover mechanisms for the controller and agents.

Restarting Services
-------------------
Restarting services is a fundamental operation in DevOpsy, often required for applying configuration changes, recovering from failures, or updating software components.

### How to Restart a Service
To restart a service, you first need to authenticate with the DevOpsy system using the CLI:

```bash
devopsy login
```

This command prompts for your credentials and establishes a session with the controller.

Next, list all running services to identify the target service:

```bash
devopsy service list
```

This will display a table of services with their IDs, names, current status, and resource usage.

Once you have the service ID, you can restart the service by issuing:

```bash
devopsy service restart <service_id>
```

For example, to restart a service with ID `svc-1234`:

```bash
devopsy service restart svc-1234
```

After restarting, verify the status to ensure the service is back online:

```bash
devopsy service status svc-1234
```

### Notes on Restarting
- Restarting a service typically causes around 30 seconds of downtime, depending on the service complexity and startup time.
- If a service is stuck and does not restart properly, you can force a restart using the `--force` flag:

```bash
devopsy service restart svc-1234 --force
```

This forcibly terminates the service's processes and triggers a clean start.

### Example Scenario
Imagine you have a chatbot ingestion service that is not responding correctly after a configuration update. Restarting the service using DevOpsy will reload the configuration and clear transient errors without requiring a full redeployment.

Scaling Services
----------------
DevOpsy supports both horizontal and vertical scaling to efficiently allocate resources based on workload demands.

### Horizontal Scaling
Horizontal scaling involves increasing or decreasing the number of service replicas running concurrently. This is useful for handling increased traffic or improving fault tolerance.

To scale horizontally, use the following command:

```bash
devopsy scale --service <service_id> --replicas <N>
```

For example, to scale the service with ID `svc-5678` to 5 replicas:

```bash
devopsy scale --service svc-5678 --replicas 5
```

DevOpsy will create or terminate containers to match the desired replica count, distributing them across available worker nodes.

### Vertical Scaling
Vertical scaling changes the resource allocation (CPU, memory) for a service instance. This helps optimize performance when a service requires more processing power or memory.

The command for vertical scaling is:

```bash
devopsy scale --service <service_id> --cpu <cores> --memory <amount>
```

For example, to allocate 4 CPU cores and 8 GB of memory to the service `svc-5678`:

```bash
devopsy scale --service svc-5678 --cpu 4 --memory 8GB
```

### Best Practices for Scaling
- Continuously monitor CPU and memory usage to identify bottlenecks.
- Avoid scaling during peak traffic hours to prevent instability.
- Combine horizontal and vertical scaling for optimal resource utilization.
- Use auto-scaling policies (if configured) for dynamic scaling based on metrics.

### Example Use Case
If a chatbot ingestion service is experiencing high latency due to CPU saturation, you can increase CPU allocation vertically. Alternatively, if the service needs to handle more concurrent requests, increase the number of replicas horizontally.

Deployments
-----------
Deploying new versions of your applications with DevOpsy is designed to be straightforward and reliable, supporting version control and rollback capabilities.

### Deployment Workflow
1. **Tag Your Code**  
   Before deploying, ensure your codebase is tagged with a semantic version. For example:

   ```bash
   git tag v1.2.3
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```

2. **Deploy the Tagged Version**  
   Use the DevOpsy CLI to deploy the tagged version:

   ```bash
   devopsy deploy --tag v1.2.3
   ```

   This command triggers the controller to pull the corresponding artifacts, update service containers, and orchestrate rolling updates.

3. **Check Deployment Status**  
   Monitor the progress:

   ```bash
   devopsy status --deployments
   ```

   This will show the deployment history, current state, and any errors encountered.

4. **Rollback if Needed**  
   If the new deployment causes issues, rollback to a previous stable version:

   ```bash
   devopsy rollback --tag v1.2.2
   ```

### Deployment Strategies
- **Rolling Updates**: DevOpsy updates services incrementally to minimize downtime.
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Supported via configuration to run two parallel environments.
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout to a subset of users for testing.

### Example Scenario
You have a new chatbot ingestion feature in version `v2.0.0`. After tagging and deploying, you notice increased error rates. You can quickly rollback to `v1.9.5` to maintain service stability while investigating.

Troubleshooting
---------------
Despite best efforts, issues may arise during service management. DevOpsy provides tools and commands to diagnose and resolve common problems.

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Service Not Restarting**  
  If a service refuses to restart, try forcing the restart:

  ```bash
  devopsy service restart <service_id> --force
  ```

  Check logs for errors:

  ```bash
  devopsy logs <service_id>
  ```

- **Deployment Stuck or Failing**  
  Verify network connectivity between controller and agents. Inspect deployment logs:

  ```bash
  devopsy logs --deployment <deployment_id>
  ```

  Ensure resource limits are not exceeded.

- **Scaling Fails**  
  Confirm that the cluster has sufficient resources. Check quota limits and adjust scaling requests accordingly.

### Log Access and Analysis
DevOpsy aggregates logs from all service instances and stores them centrally. Use:

```bash
devopsy logs <service_id> --tail 100
```

to view the last 100 log lines for quick diagnosis.
